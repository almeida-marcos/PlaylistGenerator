# PlaylistGenerators
Algorithm to automatically generate music playlists.

ROPE (B**ro**wnian **P**ath g**e**erator) is an algorithm that generates a random path in a music space. This path is created using a Brownian Motion. More detail about the algorithm can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126891).

To run the algorithm, just run rope.py.
