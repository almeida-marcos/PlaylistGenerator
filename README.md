# PlaylistGenerators
Algorithm to automatically generate music playlists.

ROPE (B**ro**wnian **P**ath g**e**erator) is an algorithm that generates a random path in a music space. This path is created using a Brownian Motion.

STRAW (**St**eered **Ra**ndom **W**alker) is an algorithm that creates a graph based on the music space, and create a random playlist by traversing it.

More detail about the algorithms can be found [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126891).

To run the algorithm, just run ```python rope.py``` or ```python straw.py```.
